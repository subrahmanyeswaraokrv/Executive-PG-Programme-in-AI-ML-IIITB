# CodePro's Junk Lead Classification

## Overview
This project involves building a machine learning model to classify leads as "junk" or "not junk." The model is designed to assist businesses in efficiently managing their leads by automatically identifying low-quality leads.

## Features
- Binary classification of leads as either "junk" or "not junk."
- Preprocessing pipeline to handle missing data, categorical encoding, and feature scaling.
- Support for hyperparameter tuning.
- Visualization of model performance metrics.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project should include the following columns (example):
- `Lead ID`: Unique identifier for the lead.
- `Lead Source`: The origin of the lead (e.g., website, email campaign).
- `Lead Score`: A numerical representation of lead quality.
- `Lead Age`: The age of the lead in days.
- `Other Features`: Any other features relevant to the classification task.

### Note:
Ensure that your dataset is cleaned and preprocessed before feeding it into the model. Missing values and inconsistencies should be addressed appropriately.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip package manager

### Install Required Libraries
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/codepro-junk-lead-classification.git
   cd codepro-junk-lead-classification
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # For Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Training the Model
1. Prepare your dataset in a CSV format and place it in the `data/` directory.
2. Run the training script:
   ```bash
   python train_model.py --data data/leads.csv --output models/
   ```

### Predicting on New Data
1. Use the trained model to classify new leads:
   ```bash
   python predict.py --model models/best_model.pkl --data data/new_leads.csv --output results/predictions.csv
   ```

## Model
The model pipeline consists of:
1. **Data Preprocessing:** Handles missing values, scales numerical features, and encodes categorical variables.
2. **Model Training:** Uses algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or XGBoost for classification.
3. **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Performed using GridSearchCV or similar techniques.

## Evaluation
Key metrics for model evaluation include:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score
- ROC-AUC

Model performance is visualized using:
- Confusion Matrix
- ROC Curve
- Precision-Recall Curve
